# Hotel-Reservation-System-Angular-Module-

A hotel reservation system is the mechanism through which guests can create secure online reservations. While the process is similar to booking with an online travel agent (OTA), the difference is the hotel’s booking engine essentially links up to their own website so that there are no additional fees incurred for the property.

In Hotel Reservation System I have created GPS module and Employee module for project

Technologies used - Angular, HTML, CSS etc. (CRUD Operation Performed)
